#'Uploads a file to Dropbox.
#'
#'This function will allow you to write files of any size to Dropbox(even ones
#'that cannot be read into memory) by uploading them in chunks.
#'
#'@param file Relative path to local file.
#'@param path The relative path on Dropbox where the file should get uploaded.
#'@param mode - "add" - will not overwrite an existing file in case of a
#'  conflict. With this mode, when a a duplicate file.txt is uploaded, it  will
#'  become file (2).txt. - "overwrite" will always overwrite a file - "update"
#'  Overwrite if the given "rev" matches the existing file's "rev".
#'@param autorename This logical determines what happens when there is a
#'  conflict. If true, the file being uploaded will be automatically renamed to
#'  avoid the conflict. (For example, test.txt might be automatically renamed to
#'  test (1).txt.) The new name can be obtained from the returned metadata. If
#'  false, the call will fail with a 409 (Conflict) response code. The default is `TRUE`
#'@param mute Set to FALSE to prevent a notification trigger on the desktop and
#'  mobile apps
#'@template verbose
#'@template token
#'@export
#' @examples \dontrun{
#' write.csv(mtcars, file = "mtt.csv")
#' drop_upload("mtt.csv")
#'}

# TODO
# add and autorename do not work
# need to add tests for update, overwrite, autorename
# need to test a few different file types
# drop_upload("mtt.txt", path = "foo/foo.txt")
# File mtt.txt uploaded as /foo/foo.txt/mtt.txt successfully at 2017-09-20T00:40:08Z
# This is an issue because it doesnâ€™t rename the files
